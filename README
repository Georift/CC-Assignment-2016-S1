This assignment implements a sliding window using Go-Back-N as it's error
handling. Messages are randomly generated by nodes and are transmitted
across the network.

Files included in the submission are:
- assignment.c - The main cnet assignment file.
- test.c       - The test cnet assignment file, it's a duplicate of
                 the actual assignment file with a correct routing table
                 for the TEST topo file.
- ASSIGNMENT   - Topography file for the main assignment specification.
- TEST         - Topography file for the test assignment solution.

To compile the assignment simply run the following commands:
    cnet ASSIGNMENT
    cnet TEST

Currently in the ASSIGNMENT file the sequence numbers get out of sync
and the nodes end up timing out consistently.

The TEST file is currently working and will work almost indefinitely.
